            <h1>Forms Matter</h1>
            <p>How the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling and shape identity</p>

            <p>Forms. They’re the often tedious tasks that stand in the way of an online purchase, seeing the doctor or filing your taxes. They may be boring, but they have tremendous power.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re filling out a form or building it yourself, you should be aware that decisions about how to design a form have all kinds of hidden consequences. How you ask a question, the order of questions, the wording and format of the questions, even whether a question is included at all — all affect the final result. Let’s take a look at how.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>How You Ask the Question: The Census</h2>
                <p>The census determines everything from how our congressional districts are drawn to how $400 billion in federal aid is distributed to enforcement of civil rights laws. Perhaps most profoundly, the census gives people the chance to define their identities, communicating how they think about themselves.</p>
                <p>But even small changes in the ways census forms ask questions can have surprising effects, and not just because of <a href="https://emergingus.com/which-box-do-you-check-on-the-census-and-why-bfb5a219cb12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the inherent limitations of asking people to put their identity in a box.</a></p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.census.gov/population/race/data/MREAD_1790_2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">census has repeatedly changed the way</a> it asks about <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/03/03/census-history-counting-hispanics-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">race and Hispanic origin</a>, for example. These are two distinct sections on the census. Between 1990 and 2000, the sequence of these sections was reversed. The 1990 form asked about race first, but the 2000 form asked about Hispanic origin first. Even more notably, the 2000 Census was the first ever to allow Americans to define themselves as members of more than one race.</p>

                <p>These design changes likely altered people’s responses, according to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/pred/www/rpts/AQE%20R&HO%20Final%20Report.pdf">2000 Census report</a> that looked specifically at the new form’s effects. In test questionnaires sent out as part of a national experiment, the number of respondents choosing two or more races doubled once people had an explicit instruction to mark “one or more,” rising from .83 percent in the 1990-style form to 2.03 percent in the 2000-style form. (In the actual 1990 census, someone who filled in more than one race would have had their response edited to choose a single race; the test allowed researchers to see how many people would mark two races despite instructions to mark one.)</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2000/02/15/census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contrary to what some feared</a>, the change was not enough to substantially reduce the number of people reporting a single race in the five main race categories (White, Black, Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander). But it did have a large effect on one group: Hispanics.</p>
                <p>Hispanics reporting as “White” went up 10 percentage points between 1990-style and 2000-style form, while reporting as “Some other race” went down by the same amount (overall Hispanic percentage of the population stayed the same). <a href="https://www.census.gov/pred/www/rpts/AQE%20R&HO%20Final%20Report.pdf">The report notes</a> that this jump “probably reflects the effect of the new “one or more” option and the reversed item sequence …” and warns that “these questionnaire effects may mask true population changes, or may masquerade as change when none has occurred.”</p>

                <h2>The Order of the Questions: The Ballot</h2>
                <p>For further proof that form effects have real consequences, just look at the ballot. The order, format and wording of questions on the ballot can (and have many times in the past) influenced how votes are cast.</p>
                <p>I’ve <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/disenfranchised-by-bad-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written about ballot design in the past</a>, and you can read much more about the impacts of unclear instructions ...</p>
